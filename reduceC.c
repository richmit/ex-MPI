              sum(i=2,n,sum(j=0,i,j))

              This program computes the silly nested sum above in
              order to demonstrate the following functions:

                    MPI_Bcast
                    MPI_Reduce
                    MPI_Gather

              This code assumes that the environment provides
              stdin/stdout for the rank 0 process. While most MPI
              implementations do provide this functionality, if yours
              doesn't then this code will fail.

      /* Just for fun (and to demonstrate gather), we collect the
         partial sums computed by the various slaves.  One might be
         tempted to use gather and sum up what is returned; however,
         this is very bad practice (a rather common bad practice
         unfortunately).  One should use reduce, as demonstrated
         later, for this application.  The reason is that a high
         performance MPI implementations will be able to use tree
         algorithms combined with knowledge of the topological
         considerations of the network to gain higher performance.
         Gather takes the locSum variables from every process and

         found in scientific message passing libs -- you won't find
