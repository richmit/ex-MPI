   @brief     Demo MPI functions MPI_Send and MPI_Recv@EOL
   @Keywords  LAM MPI
   @Std       C99 MPI1

              This program demonstrates the following functions:

                    MPI_Send
                    MPI_Recv

              Note that this program makes the same mistake that many
              real world MPI programs do.  It makes the assumption
              that no process will die and that all will end up
              sending back the part of the computation they were
              responsible for. In this program, if that doesn't
              happen, then the rank 0 process will wait forever for a
              communication that may never come.  See sendRecvErrC.c
              for a way out of this situation.

              This code requires that the rank zero process have
              stdout capabilities -- which most MPI implementations
              provide.
